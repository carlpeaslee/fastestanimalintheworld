    <h1>Zebra</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Zebras can go about 40 miles per hour.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Do you know why they have stripes? It's because it helps them camouflage in the pack and the predators get dizzy as they watch.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Every zebra has a different pattern. </li>
    </ul>
